Django Task #1 (with UI)
						
Create a small, working Django site that serves a simple activity feed list with 3 filters:

1.My posts
2.Me and the posts of everyone I’m tracking (note: use an asymmetric relationship, meaning, “Even if I track you, you may or may not track me”.)
3.Everybody’s posts
						
You can serve HTML, JSON, or XML, but there’s no need to groom the output for aesthetics, i.e., don’t spend time on positioning, CSS, etc.
The goal is to get the backend working. Create sample data with the admin site; no need for POST or PUT endpoints here.
And feel free to pull in whatever Python or Django packages you want. If you do such, please provide a requirements.txt with your app code.
